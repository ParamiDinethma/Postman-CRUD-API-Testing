🧪 Automated API Testing Portfolio - User Management CRUDProject OverviewThis project is an automated API test suite developed using Postman to validate the foundational CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a User Management resource.It serves as a professional demonstration of functional API testing skills, leveraging environment variables for test chaining and JavaScript assertions for robust response validation.Target API: Reqres (A hosted REST-API for testing purposes).Base URL: https://reqres.in/api🛠️ Skills DemonstratedThis collection showcases the following critical API testing competencies:CRUD Validation: Comprehensive testing of POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.Test Chaining: Using JavaScript in Postman's "Post-response Scripts" (Tests) to extract data from one request's response (id from a POST) and inject it into subsequent requests (GET, PUT, DELETE).Environment Variables: Effective use of a centralized Environment to manage dynamic data ({{newUserId}}) and configuration ({{baseUrl}}).Automated Assertions: Writing robust test scripts using the Chai.js syntax (pm.expect()) to validate status codes, response content, data types, and required fields.Collection Runner: Executing the entire suite sequentially to ensure end-to-end workflow integrity.📁 Collection StructureThe collection is organized to simulate a real-world user workflow:#Request NameMethodEndpointPurposeKey Test1Create New UserPOST{{baseUrl}}/usersCreates a new user record.Saves the new id to {{newUserId}} environment variable.2Get Single UserGET{{baseUrl}}/users/{{newUserId}}Retrieves the newly created user.Validates the retrieved data matches the creation request.3Update UserPUT{{baseUrl}}/users/{{newUserId}}Modifies the details of the existing user.Validates the job field is updated correctly.4Delete UserDELETE{{baseUrl}}/users/{{newUserId}}Deletes the user record.Validates the successful deletion response code (204 No Content).5List All UsersGET{{baseUrl}}/users?page=2Validates pagination and list retrieval.Checks for 12 records in the data array.🚀 Setup and ExecutionPrerequisitesPostman Desktop App (or Web App) installed.1. Import the CollectionIn Postman, click Import.Select the User Management - Reqres CRUD Tests.json file provided in this repository.2. Configure the EnvironmentGo to the Environments tab in the sidebar.Select the Reqres-Test-Env.Ensure the following variable is configured:VariableValueDescriptionbaseUrlhttps://reqres.in/apiThe root URL for all API calls.newUserId(Initial: Empty)Dynamically set by the POST request for test chaining.Crucial: Select the Reqres-Test-Env from the environment dropdown at the top right of Postman.3. Run the Test SuiteNavigate to the Collections tab.Click on the collection name (User Management - Reqres CRUD Tests).Click the Run tab (or the Run button).Ensure the requests are ordered correctly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).Click the Run Collection button. The entire workflow will execute sequentially.⚠️ Known Issues / Troubleshooting (Real-World QA)Note for Reviewers: While developing, I encountered intermittent 403 Forbidden errors during the POST request. This demonstrates a real-world challenge where server-side or configuration issues can occur.If you encounter a 403 Forbidden error:Check https: Ensure the baseUrl environment variable uses https (secure protocol).Verify Body Format: Confirm the Body tab of the POST request is set to raw and the type is explicitly set to JSON.Fixing these issues should allow the request to return the expected 201 Created status, enabling the rest of the test chain to execute successfully.
